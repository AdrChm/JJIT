00001 Juliet
00002 O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
00003 Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
00004 Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
00005 And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
00006 Romeo
00007 [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
00008 Juliet
00009 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
00010 Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
00011 What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,                    
00012 Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
00013 Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
00014 What's in a name? That which we call a rose,
00015 By any other word would smell as sweet.
00016 So Romeo would — were he not Romeo called —
00017 Retain that dear perfection which he owes
00018 Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
00019 And for that name, which is no part of thee,
00020 Take all myself.
00021 Romeo
00022                           [Aloud] I take thee at thy word.
00023 Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;                    
00024 Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
00025 Juliet
00026 What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night,
00027 So stumblest on my counsel?
00028 Romeo
00029                                                 By a name
00030 I know not how to tell thee who I am.
00031 My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
00032 Because it is an enemy to thee.
00033 Had I it written, I would tear the word.
00034 Juliet
00035 My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
00036 Of that tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound.
00037 Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?                           
00038 Romeo
00039 Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
00040 Juliet
00041 How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
00042 The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
00043 And the place death, considering who thou art,
00044 If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
00045 Romeo
00046 With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls,
00047 For stony limits cannot hold love out;
00048 And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
00049 Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
00050 Juliet
00051 If they do see thee, they will murder thee.                     
00052 Romeo
00053 Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
00054 Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,
00055 And I am proof against their enmity.
00056 Juliet
00057 I would not for the world they saw thee here.
00058 Romeo
00059 I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes,
00060 And but thou love me, let them find me here.
00061 My life were better ended by their hate,
00062 Than death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.
