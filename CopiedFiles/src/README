This file is created to avoid class duplications required by this chapter,
so new versions of already existing classes and the other, related to these
new copies are put here.
Add Clone to these classes name would be another solution, but requiring much
more effort in terms of testing and ensuring compatibility with other already
existing classes.
This might be changed in future, or this directory might extent to cover future
chapters as well if this will be necessary.
