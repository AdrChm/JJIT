I know, I'm not the one 
to fake it, will you know.
You're ready for the fall.
I'm here to keep you up.
Enough today light start to glow.
You don't belong to me.
You're ready for the fall.
Ohhhh, Ohhhh
For, For, Ohhhh
You're ready for the fall.
I know, I'm not the one 
to fake it will you know.
You're ready for the fall.
I'm here to keep you up.
Enough today light start to glow.
You don't belong to me.
You're ready for the fall.
You're ready for the fall.
